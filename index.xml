Flag Four army_hacker_team_got_root: Wow, you found the final flag. Well done. In cybersecurity competitions called capture-the-flag, aspring or full fledge hackers attempt to recover strings of characters called flags. These flags represent critical data that is intended to be protected by the system. It could be passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or even the full schematics of a DS-1 Orbital Battle Station.</description>
